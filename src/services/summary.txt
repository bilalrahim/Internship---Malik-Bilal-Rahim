1. I have several years of experience of building REST API's in them.

2. Advanatages:
  1. Well architected.
  2. Cleanly written.
  3. Modular.

  Disadvanatages:
  1. No Database.
  2. It saves negative points to the payer which should not be the case but that is what the sample test data had. If I had added
     a condition to prevent negative values, I would not have gotten the result of the test data.

3. I have faced many challenges that were quite unique and new, one of my favourite one was when I was working as a backend engineer at a startup and we had to ensure that our platform; a marketplace
   for sharing/renting everyday household items, could have only one account per user. What I found most challenging was figuring out how to solve that problem. I came up with the idea of using stripe identity
   which would ask user for their driving license which strip would identify and ensure we only have that one single user on our platform.
